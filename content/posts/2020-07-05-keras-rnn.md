[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. In this post, we'll build a simple [Recurrent Neural Network](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) (RNN) and train it to solve a real problem with Keras.

This post is intended for **complete beginners to Keras** but does assume a **basic background knowledge of RNNs**. My [introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) covers everything you need to know (and more) for this post - read that first if necessary.

Here we go!
