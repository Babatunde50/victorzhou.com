[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. In this post, we'll build a simple [Recurrent Neural Network](/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/) (RNN) and train it to solve a real problem with Keras.

This post is intended for **complete beginners to Keras** but does assume a **basic background knowledge of RNNs**. My [introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) covers everything you need to know (and more) for this post - I highly recommend reading that first.

Here we go!

## The Problem

We'll implement an RNN in Keras to perform the same Sentiment Analysis task we tackled in my [introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](/blog/intro-to-rnns/) : **determining whether a given text string is positive or negative.**

Here are a few samples from the small [dataset](https://github.com/vzhou842/rnn-from-scratch/blob/master/data.py) I put together for this problem:

| Text | Positive? |
| --- | --- |
| i am good | <span class="checkmark">✓</span> |
| i am bad | ❌ |
| this is very good | <span class="checkmark">✓</span> |
| this is not bad | <span class="checkmark">✓</span> |
| i am bad not good | ❌ |
| i am not at all happy | ❌ |
| this was good earlier | <span class="checkmark">✓</span> |
| i am not at all bad or sad right now | <span class="checkmark">✓</span> |

## 1. Setup

I'm assuming you already have a basic Python installation ready (you probably do). Let's first install some packages we'll need:

```bash
$ pip install keras tensorflow numpy
```

> Note: We need to install `tensorflow` because we're going to run Keras on a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) backend (i.e. TensorFlow will power Keras).

Next, [download the dataset](https://github.com/vzhou842/rnn-from-scratch/blob/master/data.py) (or copy and paste it) and put it in a file named `data.py`. It should look something like this:

```python
# Header: data.py
train_data = {
  'good': True,
  'bad': False,
  # ... more data
}

test_data = {
  'this is happy': True,
  'i am good': True,
  # ... more data
}
```

You should now be able to import the dataset and poke around:

```python
from data import train_data, test_data
import numpy as np

print(len(train_data))
print(len(test_data)))
```
