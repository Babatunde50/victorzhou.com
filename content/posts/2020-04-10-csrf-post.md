You've probably seen the phrase _Cross-Site Request Forgery_ (CSRF) thrown around somewhere before. To sum it up simply, CSRF is a web security exploit where an attacker induces a victim to **perform an action they didn't mean to.** In this post, you'll see _firsthand_ how CSRF works. Ready?

## Setting the Scene

You're a responsible, hardworking person. You've saved up your money over the years at **Definitely Secure Bank¬Æ**. You love Definitely Secure Bank - they've always been good to you, plus they make it easy to deposit or transfer money via their website. Sweet, right?

To get in character, let's have you open up your online banking portal and look around. <b><a href="http://localhost:3000/login" target="_blank">Click here to open Definitely Secure Bank's website</a></b> and login. Use **any username** and **any password** you want (don't worry - it's _definitely_ secure). Keep that tab open for the rest of this post.

Once you've logged in, you should see a landing page that looks something like this:

Nice! You've got $20,000 saved up! It'd be a shame if someone stole it...

One fateful day, you get an email titled: **‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Time Offer! üéÅ Get a $100 Visa Gift Card Now!! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

<span class="emph-special">Woah</span>, you think to yourself, <span class="emph-special">I could use a free $100 gift card!</span> What could go wrong? You open the email and click the link:

<div>
  <csrf-post-button use-get-request=true>Click Here to get your free $100</csrf-post-button>
</div>

> Assuming that button worked, you should've just seen an alert saying you'd receive your $100 gift card soon.

<span class="emph-special">Nice! That was an easy $100</span>, you think while mentally patting yourself on the back.

Little do you know, there's no \$100 gift card (what?!?!) - in fact, **you've just lost $10,000.** Don't believe me? Go check your [Definitely Secure Bank](http://localhost:3000/) tab (the one I told you to keep open for this post). It should look something like this:

TODO SCREENSHOT

<span class="emph-special">No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>, you scream (silently in your head). <span class="emph-special">Impossible! How could this happen??</span>

## How It Happened

Here's the Javascript that was run when you clicked that button:
