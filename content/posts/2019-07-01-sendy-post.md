When I [started this blog](/blog/first-50-days-of-blogging/), I used Mailchimp to create an email newsletter so readers could sign up to get new posts in their inbox. This was an easy choice: Mailchimp has a good free tier, is super easy to setup, and is a pleasure to use.

My email newsletter has grown since those early days, though, and I'm going to pass the 2,000 subscriber mark soon ðŸŽ‰, which is where Mailchimp's free tier ends. Thus, I did a bit of research to see how much it would cost me to keep my newsletter on Mailchimp:

ðŸ˜². At just 500 subscribers past the free tier limit, it would cost **$30 / month** to maintain my email list, _even if I didn't send any emails_.

It gets worse: I'd previously set [a goal to reach 10,000 subscribers](/blog/first-50-days-of-blogging/#goals-for-year-one) by the end of my first year of blogging. Here's what life with Mailchimp would look like if I hit that milestone:

**$75 / month** at 10k subscribers. Let's put that in perspective:

Yup - it was time to say goodbye to Mailchimp.

## Amazon SES

I'd heard that Amazon had some kind of email offering before, so I decided to check that out first. It's called the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and it lives up to its name: 

Amazon SES's pricing is attractive, but it's missing a lot of features. Sure, I could implement everything I needed from scratch, but that's got to be against some kind of programmer's oath, right? I knew _someone_ else must've done this already...

## Sendy

...and I was right! That's what [Sendy](https://sendy.co/?ref=Tl4Ot) is for: it implements everything you'd want for an email newsletter on top of Amazon SES. Pricing is simple: you pay a one time fee of $59 to buy a copy of Sendy, and after that it's yours to use forever - you only pay [Amazon SES costs](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/) after that.

That's a big difference from Mailchimp - assuming 4 emails per month, here's how the monthly costs for each add up:

| # of Subscribers | Mailchimp (cheapest plan) Cost | Sendy Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2,000 | $0 | $0.80 |
| 5,000 | $50 | $2 |
| 10,000 | $75 | $4 |
| 25,000 | $189 | $10 |
| 50,000 | $259 | $20 |

Nothing more needs to be said. That table speaks for itself.

### Sendy Setup

One downside of using Sendy is that you have to setup / host it yourself. However, this is really not that bad! Here's a quick runthrough of the steps I took to get up and running with Sendy:

1. Rent a \$5 server from [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/0e6cb6018b2a) (yes, this is a referral link, but you'll get $50 of credit and help subsidize my hosting costs if you use it!) with a pre-installed [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) stack.
2. Setup MySQL by creating a user and database for Sendy.
3. Edit the `config.php` file provided in the Sendy source code to include the correct values of `dbHost`, `dbUser`, `dbPass`, and `dbName`.
4. Upload the Sendy source code to my server using [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync).
5. Install a few PHP libraries and fiddle with a few settings (see the [Sendy Server Compatibility Checklist](https://sendy.victorzhou.com/_compatibility.php?i=1) for more details).
6. Finalize the Sendy installation using the provided License Key.

My installation method requires a bit of sysadmin background, but it's also easy to install Sendy on something like Wordpress without any technical requirements.
