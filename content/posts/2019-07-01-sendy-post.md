When I [started this blog](/blog/first-50-days-of-blogging/), I used Mailchimp to create an email newsletter so readers could sign up to get new posts in their inbox. This was an easy choice: Mailchimp has a good free tier, is super easy to setup, and is a pleasure to use.

My email newsletter has grown since those early days, though, and I'm going to pass the 2,000 subscriber mark soon ðŸŽ‰, which is where Mailchimp's free tier ends. Thus, I did a bit of research to see how much it would cost me to keep my newsletter on Mailchimp:

Woah ðŸ˜². At just 500 subscribers past the free tier limit, it would cost **$30 / month** to just maintain my email list.

It gets worse: I'd previously set [a goal to reach 10,000 subscribers](/blog/first-50-days-of-blogging/#goals-for-year-one) by the end of my first year of blogging. Here's what life with Mailchimp would look like if I hit that milestone:

**$75 / month** at 10k subscribers. Let's put that in perspective:

It was time to say goodbye to Mailchimp.

## Amazon SES

I'd heard that Amazon had some kind of email offering before, so I decided to check that out first. It's called the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and it lives up to its name: 

Amazon SES's pricing is attractive, but it's missing a lot of features. Sure, I could implement everything I needed from scratch, but that's got to be against the programmer's oath or something, right? I _knew_ someone else must've done this already...

## Sendy

...and I was right! That's what [Sendy TODO LINK]() is for: it implements everything you'd want for an email newsletter on top of Amazon SES. Pricing is simple: you pay a one time fee of $x to buy a copy of Sendy, and after that it's yours to use forever - you only pay Amazon SES costs after that.

That's a big difference from Mailchimp:
