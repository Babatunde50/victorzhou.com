        Machine Learning is, put simply, getting computers to generalize from examples. And that's
        what I try to do: <b>put [seemingly complicated] things simply</b>. My posts on Machine
        Learning (ML) consist primarily of beginner-focused introductions to common ML models or
        concepts. I felt like too many ML tutorials weren't accessible enough, so I strove to make
        my guides <b>as clear and beginner-friendly as possible</b>.
